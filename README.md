## Problem Statement 

With the increasing number of movies being released every year, it can be difficult for movie enthusiasts to keep track of all the movies they want to watch and have watched. Additionally, finding information about movies such as release dates, ratings, reviews, and cast and crew details can be time-consuming and cumbersome. There is a need for a centralized platform where users can easily browse, search, and organize their movie collection, as well as access detailed information about movies. A movie collection site could address this problem by providing a user-friendly interface for managing a personal movie library and accessing comprehensive movie information. This would enhance the movie-watching experience for users and help them discover new movies to watch.

## Proposed Solution 

#### DekhoSa - get Movies & Shows.
It is bacically a Movies collection platform, where users can experience the popular movies of all kind and also keep them aware new upcoming movies.
This platform is unlike those which released information of all movies, it only presents the kind and types which are rated good.

A *user-friendly interface* for browsing, searching, and organized movie collection.

By implementing these features, the movie collection site could provide a centralized platform for movie enthusiasts to discover new movies to watch without spending much time in searching.
